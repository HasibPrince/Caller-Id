## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Material UI Library, XML
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Call Managing Api:** CallScreeningService
- **Phone Number Utitly:** libphonenumber
- **Database:** Room
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Kotlin Coroutines

## Architecture

This project follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Model**:  
   - Responsible for handling data operations like fetching contacts related data.  
   - Example: `Repository` classes.

1. **Domain**:
   - Defines Models and Data repositories  
   - Responsible for handling business logic and use cases.    

2. **ViewModel**:  
   - Acts as a bridge between the `Model` and `View`.  
   - Manages UI-related data and state.  

3. **View**:  
   - Implements the user interface via **Material UI Library**.  
   - Observes data changes from the `ViewModel` and renders the UI.
